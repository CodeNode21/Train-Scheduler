# Train-Scheduler

In this project we are creating a train scheduler which incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. App retrieves and manipulates this information using Moment.js.
It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely thier arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
