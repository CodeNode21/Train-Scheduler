# Train-Scheduler

In this project we are creating a train scheduler which incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. App retrieves and manipulates this information using Moment.js.
It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely thier arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The train scheduler is an application which logs train arrivals and displays next arriving train. 
User can add new trains and their intervals which then the app will save the data and use it.
